### I lead the [Californian Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit (CESU)](http://www.cesu.psu.edu/unit_portals/CALI_portal.htm) for the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). The CESU:


- Facilitates scientific collaborations between the federal government and the University of California, California State University, and many other research partners.

- Provides technical expertise in ecology and biostatistics.

I am also a Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley working on marine ecology, data science, and biostatistics and am involved in a wide variety of collaborative research projects (with a common theme of long-term monitoring). Some recent and ongoing projects include: 
- eelgrass restoration in Drakes Estero
- pinniped population dynamics (harbor seals and elephant seals) in Central California
- northern spotted owl occupancy in Marin County
- cattle and elk grazing impacts in a Mediterranean climate
- dairy and beef operation impacts on water quality
- invasive plant impacts on native soils
- seabird ecology and conservation
- california current oceanography
- coho salmon occupancy modeling
- rocky intertidal community ecology

### Please get in touch with me if you are:
- A CESU University or Partner (Faculty, researcher, or student) interested in research partnerships and opportuntities with the National Park Service.

- A student interested in data or field oriented natural resource internships.
