### *Mission* 
*CESUs connect the [NPS](https://www.nps.gov) to the forefront of science and scholarship to advance stewardship of our nation’s natural and cultural resources. They stimulate multidisciplinary and collaborative studies benefiting the NPS, scientific and scholarly communities, and the public at large. We also help train the next generation of scientists in managing public lands.*

Welcome to the CA-CESU Website. I serve as the CA-CESU Science Advisor and Research Coordinator at UC Berkeley as a Visiting Scholar working on marine ecology, data science, and biostatistics in a wide variety of collaborative research projects (with a common theme of long-term monitoring). Some recent and ongoing projects include: 
- eelgrass restoration in Drakes Estero
- pinniped population dynamics (harbor seals and elephant seals) in Central California
- northern spotted owl occupancy in Marin County
- cattle and elk grazing impacts in a Mediterranean climate
- dairy and beef operation impacts on water quality
- invasive plant impacts on native soils
- seabird ecology and conservation
- california current oceanography and climate change
- coho salmon occupancy modeling
- rocky intertidal community ecology
