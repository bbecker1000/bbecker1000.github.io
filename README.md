## Welcome Ben Becker's GitHub Page

I lead the Californian Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit (CESU) for the National Park Service at UC Berkeley. The CESU facilitates scientific collaborations between the federal government and the University of California, California State University, and many other research partners.

I am also a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley working on marine ecology, data science, and biostatistics. I work on a wide variety of research projects (with a common theme of long-term monitoring) with many partners federal, state, and academic partners including: 
- eelgrass restoration
- pinniped population dynamics (harbor seals and elephant seals)
- northern spotted owl occupancy
- cattle and elk grazing impacts in a Mediterranean climate
- dairy and beef operation impacts on water quality
- invasive plant impacts on native soils
- seabird ecology and conservation
- california current oceanography
- coho salmon occupancy modeling
- rocky intertidal community ecology

## Please get in touch with me if you are:
- A CESU University or Partner (Faculty, researcher, or student) interested in research partnerships and opportuntities with the National Park Service.
